.SYNOPSIS
	Purpose of this script is to workaround an issue in Office 365 where it was not possible to remove multiple management role entries in a single pipeline operation

	For more details please also see this post:
    http://blogs.technet.com/b/rmilne/archive/2015/02/05/remove-multiple-management-role-entries-in-office-365.aspx
	

.DESCRIPTION
	Update script with the management role entries that you want to remove.  

	Management role entries are specified in the format of:
		ManagementRoleName\cmdlet(s)

	For example you could specify examples like the below:
		ManagementRoleName\Set-Mailbox
		ManagementRoleName\Set-*
		ManagementRoleName\Set-Mail* 

	Cannot remove all management role entries from the management role. Built-In management role entries cannot be removed.  
	Can only remove from writeable management roles. 

	In the script below edit this line to specify the Management Role Entries that are being removed 
	$MREs = Get-ManagementRoleEntry "Level1-HelpDesk\Set-Mail*"

	
	In this example level1-Helpdesk is a custom management role that was created  from Mail Recipients.  In the example want to remove any cmdlet that
	matches Set-Mail* 

	Level1-HelpDesk\Set-Mail*" 

	
	By default script will prompt for removal of management role entries.  This is to ensure that changes are reviewed and are desirable.
	Can be changed by sett the variable $Confirmation to $False 
	



.ASSUMPTIONS
	Script is being executed with sufficient permissions
	
	Script is being executed whilst being connected to Exchange.  

	You can live with the Write-Host cmdlets :)

	You really want these management role entries removed......
